# Rich Text Editor for WinForms - How to Export the RichEditControl Document into an Outlook Mail Item

The following example describes how to send the mail merge result as an e-mail.

## Implementation Details

In some scenarios, you might wish just to transfer the RichEditControl document into Outlook. In this case, use [Outlook Interop API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/outlook/pia/welcome-to-the-outlook-primary-interop-assembly-reference?redirectedfrom=MSDN) to prepare a mail item based on the RichEditControl content. Process images via a custom [IUriProvider](https://docs.devexpress.com/OfficeFileAPI/DevExpress.Office.Services.IUriProvider) interface implementation. Convert native RichEdit images into Outlook mail item attachments.
